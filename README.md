A GitHub `gh` [CLI](https://cli.github.com/) extension to list environments and their
associated metadata for an organization and/or specific repositories.

## Installation

1. Install the `gh` CLI - see the [installation](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) instructions.

2. Install the extension:

   ```sh

   ```

For more information: [`gh extension install`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_extension_install).

## Usage

The `gh-environments` extension supports `GitHub.com` and GitHub Enterprise Server, through
the use of `--hostname` and the following commands:

```sh
$ gh environments -h
